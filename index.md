I explore the intersections of history, business, and global capitalism. As a Senior Lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, my research spans entrepreneurship, urban history, and leadership across diverse cultures. My latest book, *Bankrolling Empire*, delves into the financial and political transformations of Mughal India.

Here, you’ll find my writings, research, and thoughts on history’s impact on the modern world. Feel free to connect with me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudev-sheth/) or explore my latest works on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ldgGoNYAAAAJ&hl=en).
